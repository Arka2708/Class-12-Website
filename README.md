# Class-12-Website
This is a webpage which I made when I was studying in class 12th and just started learning HTML and CSS so I made this as a project, trying different elements, styles and attributes to get used to it, I know it's not that much of good looking or professional but as a project making something for the first always makes it special and close to heart.
